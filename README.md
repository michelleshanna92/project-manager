# Personal Idea Board

The Personal Idea Board is an application that allows the user to add one or multiple ideas and store information on a personal board. This application is developed for users looking to keep track of their ideas and eliminate the inconvenience of having to forget a potentially useful idea. Here are some advantages of using Task Manager:

* Worry-free customization
* The user has no limit on how many ideas they can add/remove
* Each user gets their own private interspace when they create an account

## How It Works
1. The user must create an account by creating a username and password
2. The account information will be stored in a database and login information will be active
3. The user Logs in and can now add a an idea they want to remember!
